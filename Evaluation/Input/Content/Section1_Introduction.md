Carbamazepine, sold under the trade name Tegretol<sup>Â®</sup> among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used primarily to treat epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Other indications include schizophrenia where it is used as an adjunctive treatment along with other medications, and bipolar disorder where it is used as a second-line agent. Carbamazepine is typically taken by mouth on empty stomach or together with meals, depending on the administered formulation. With the exception of e.g. grapefruit juice, the intake of food was generally found to have no significant impact on carbamazepine pharmacokinetics ([Tedeschi 1981](#5-References), [McLean 2001](#5-References)).

Carbamazepine is extensively metabolized by various enzymes including CYP2B6, 2C8, 3A4, and UGT2B7 ([Kerr 1994](#5-References), [Pelkonen 2001](#5-References), [Staines 2004](#5-References)). Following oral administration the major dose fraction is metabolized to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide ([Eichelbaum 1985](#5-References), [Tomson 1983](#5-References)). This reaction is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4, with some contribution from CYP2C8 ([Kerr 1994](#5-References)). After oral administration, a minor fraction of the dose (approximately 1 - 3%) is excreted unchanged in urine ([Bernus 1994](#5-References), [Morselli 1975](#5-References)), while approximately 1% of the dose can be recovered as unchanged drug in the bile ([Terhaag 1978](#5-References)).

Carbamazepine is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a strong CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 inducer (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-interactions-labeling/drug-development-and-drug-interactions) and hence induces its own metabolism.

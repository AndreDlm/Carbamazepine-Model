The general workflow for building an adult PBPK model has been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#5-references)). Relevant information on the anthropometry (height, weight) was gathered from the respective clinical study, if reported. Information on physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, hematocrit) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been incorporated in PK-Sim<sup>速</sup>) as described previously ([Willmann 2007](#5-references)). The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim<sup>速</sup> are described in the publicly available 'PK-Sim<sup>速</sup> Ontogeny Database Version 7.3' ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#5-references)).

The PBPK model was developed based on publicly available clinical data of adult healthy subjects. In a first step, a model was developed for carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide using pharmacokinetic data from three clinical studies administering carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide at an oral dose ranging from 50 to 200 mg as solution or tablet. This model includes metabolism by EPHX1 and unchanged renal excretion via passive glomerular filtration. Thereafter, a model was developed for carbamazepine that was combined with the carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide model. For the development of the parent-metabolite model, pharmacokinetic data from various clinical studies were used that covered a dosing range from 10 to 600 mg carbamazepine in different formulations (solution, immediate release and extended release formulations), administered under fasted conditions or together with food. The carbamazepine model includes metabolism by CYP2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 as well as an unspecific clearance pathway (implemented as `liver plasma clearance` process) and as minor elimination pathway unchanged renal excretion. Induction of CYP2B6, 3A4, and EPHX1 by carbamazepine was included.

Unknown parameters (see below) were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim<sup>速</sup>. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility. Further details on model building are been described elsewhere ([Fuhr 2021](#5-References)).

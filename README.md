Within this repository we share a whole-body parent-metabolite PBPK model of carbamazepine and its main metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. The model was developed using a large number of clinical studies and was evaluated with in a DDI modeling network. The model describes DDIs with carbamazepine as CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 substrate and/or inducer. 

For a detailed documentation of model development, quantitative model evaluation and sensitivity analysis, please refer to [1].

This repository contains:

- a PK-Sim snapshot (*.json) file of the current PBPK model
- static content (e.g. text blocks, *.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model

**The latest release of the snapshot of the model, the evaluation plan and the static content can be found [here](../../releases/latest).**

**The latest release of the PK-Sim project model file and the respective evaluation report can be found [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/OSP-PBPK-Model-Library/releases/latest).**



The carbamazepine model provided in this branch of the repository is identical to the model originally published by Fuhr et al. [[1](https://github.com/AndreDlm/Carbamazepine-Model#references)]. The model was developed using a large number of clinical studies and is intended to be used as perpetrator drug in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI).
